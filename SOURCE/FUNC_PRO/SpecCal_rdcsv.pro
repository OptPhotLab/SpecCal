; :Description:
;    Reads an input CSV file and returns info about wavelenghts, irradiance and FWHM.
;
; :Params:
;    file: Input CSV file to be read by the program. The file must be a semicolumn delimited csv . 
;           The first line is an Header. Second line reports the wavelenght and irradiance values for the first channel, and the nominal FWHM of the 
;           spectroradiometer. Following lines contain wavelenghts and Irradiance or Counts values for the othe channels.
;       e.g.:       
;       1st line:            Wl;   U_Meas;   fwhm
;       2nd line:           717;   0.297;   0.13
;       3rd line:            718;   0.256; 
;       .........                   ..........  .......
;      nth line:           717.02; 0.296; 
;      
;      If Unit_Measure is equal to "Counts" then a "Basic" radiometric calibration is performed BEFORE running the spectral calibration
;
; :OUTPUTS:
;  info_csv:  structure containing fields:
;    -  wl: wavelenghts
;    -  vals: Irradiance values
;    -  fwhm: Nominal FWHM
;    - U_Meas: Measurement unit for vals. If equal to "Counts" then  a "Basic" radiometric calibration is performed BEFORE running the spectral calibration
