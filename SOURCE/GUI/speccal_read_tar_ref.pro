;:ROUTINE NAME:
;SpecCal_Read_Tar_Ref
;
; :PURPOSE:
;   Read the target reflectance CSV file
;:PARAMS:
;    in_file: Input target reflectance file
; 	 tar_ref: array containing target reflectance data (used to check dimensions)
;
; :RETURNS:
;   upon return, the rar_ref variable contains the data regarding spectral reflectance of the target, as read form 
;   the selected file
;
; :REQUIRES:
;
; :NOTES:
;   Target reflectance file must be a CSV file (';' delimited) with 701 rows(Reflectance from 350 to 1050, with Sampling of 1 nm) and this structure:
;       row1:            wl  ;   Refl
;       row2:           350  ; 0.0001
;       row2:           351  ;  0.0002
;                ....        ....        .....
;       row701:      1050 ;     0.0002
