SpecCal v.1.2
=============

SpecCal: a novel software for in-field spectral characterization of high-resolution spectrometers

SpecCal is a stand-alone IDL application for the in-field spectral calibration of high-resolution spectrometers, based on the spectral matching algorithm proposed by Meroni et al. (2010)

Installation Instructions: 
--------------------------

This distribution of SpecCal includes both the source code, and a Microsoft Windows executable file exploiting the IDL Virtual Machine©, to allow its execution also without a working IDL license.

SpecCal can be installed by following the following simple steps: 

1) Decompress the archive "SpecCal_v12.zip" (Please be sure that the option specifying to extract the full paths of the files is selected within the decompressing software of choice (e.g., WINZIP, WINRAR, etc.)

2) Check the installation folder. After the decompression, the following sub-folders should have been created in the selected installation folder:

\EXAMPLE_INPUT_DATA; \EXAMPLE_OUTPUT_DATA; \HELP; \LOG_FILES; \MODTRAN_FILES; \OUTPUTS; \PREVIOUS; \SOURCE; \TARGET_REFLECTANCES

3) Run the software by doubl-clicking on the “SpecCal_12.exe” file within the main installation folder. When the IDL Virtual Machine splash screen appears, click on “Continue”, and the SpecCal GUI should appear


For further info regarding the installation process, please consult the SpecCal User's Guide that can be found in the "\HELP" subfolder.
